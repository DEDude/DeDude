## Hi, I'm DeDude

Data / platform engineer and accidental jack-of-all-trades.  
Currently working with **Databricks on Azure**, **Spark**, **Terraform**, and **Drone CI**, with a bias toward:
- Reliable lakehouse-style data platforms
- Infrastructure as code and automated deployments
- Internal dev tools that remove friction for engineers

### What I work with

- **Data & compute:** Databricks (Azure), ADF, Spark, Delta Lake, SQL
- **Cloud & infra:** AWS, Terraform, Docker, Drone CI
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, bash, a bit of Go / Scala where it hurts less
- **Interests:** developer experience, data quality, observability, grimly practical automation

### Currently

- Building data / platform stuff around Databricks on Azure
- Experimenting with dev tools and automation in my spare time
- Occasionally shipping things instead of just refactoring them
